## MLJModels

Selected packages which do not yet provide native
[MLJ](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl) implementations
of their models are provided "strap-on" implementations contained in
this repository. The implementation code is automatically loaded by
MLJ when the relevant package is imported (using "lazy-loading" - see
[Requires.jl](https://github.com/MikeInnes/Requires.jl)).
